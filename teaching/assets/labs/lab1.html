<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description,
		contain a <tt>main()</tt> function and an invocation of the main at the end of the file:
		For example:
	<pre>
#Name: Herbert H. Lehman
#Date: September 4, 2013
#This program prints: hello world

def main():
	print("Hello world")
	
main()
	</pre>
<!--	<li> About one of every five submitted programs will be chosen, at random, for complete grading.	
-->
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<!--<li> Extra credit will be awarded for the programs that are chosen for complete grading 
	that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early, 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early, 2 extra credit points will be awarded. -->
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using Blackboard, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (15%
	of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all 
	incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>

<p>
<b>Timing Out:</b> If the system times out and locks your attempt (happens rarely 
when the browser or PC crashes), send email to an instructor so they
can clear the attempt so you can try again.

<h3>Using Python</h3>

<p>We will be using the IDLE programming environment for Python.  On the desktop,
there is an <tt>Idle</tt> icon.  Click the icon to launch idle.  In the shell
window that pops up, try typing some of the commands that we did in lecture (also
from the textbook):
<pre>
	print("Hello, world!")
	print()
	def greet(person):
	   print("Hello", person)
	greet("world")
</pre>
(Indentation does matter, so, remember to indent the <tt>print</tt> line, using TABs, 
so that it is included in the <tt>greet()</tt> function.)

<p>Next, let's write a program that will greet someone 5 times.  Instead of using
the shell window (which lets us try things immediately), let's use a text window, where
we can save our program for later.  The basic structure
of the program will be:
<pre>
#Define our function
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	#Inside that loop, greet that person 
</pre>
Copy the above lines into a new text window.  Save, using the name, <tt>greetLoop.py</tt>
to your USB drive.  If you try to run your program, it will currently give an error since there's nothing for it to do, 
since all the lines are proceeded by the `#' and treated as a comment.

<p>
Let's fill in a bit more of the program:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	#Inside that loop, greet that person 
	print("Hello", person)
</pre>
Save your revised program and run it (using the "Run module" from the run menu or F5 key).  
At the shell, if you type:
<pre>
greetLoop("World")
</pre>
how many times does the message get printed?  Why?

<p>
Let's add in the missing loop, to make it print out the multiple times:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	for i in range(5):
	#Inside that loop, greet that person 
	print("Hello", person)
</pre>
Save your revised program and run it (using the "Run module" from the run menu or F5 key).  
At the shell, if you type:
<pre>
greetLoop("World")
</pre>
how many times does the message get printed?  What went wrong?  A loop only repeats
statements indented below it.  Since our print statement wasn't indented, it decided
we had an `empty loop' followed by a simple print statement.  To include the
print statement in the loop, we add indentation:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	for i in range(5):
		#Inside that loop, greet that person 
		print("Hello", person)
</pre>
Save your revised program and run it (using the "Run module" from the run menu or F5 key).  
At the shell, if you type:
<pre>
greetLoop("World")
</pre>
how many times does the message get printed?

<p>Change your program so the message is printed 25 times.  

<p>A common thing to include in your Python file is a call (or "invocation") to
the function at the end of the file:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	for i in range(5):
		#Inside that loop, greet that person 
		print("Hello", person)

greetLoop("Herbert")		
</pre>
When you run the program ("Run module" or F5), the program will be loaded and
the function is called automatically.  In this case, it will call the function,
<tt>greetLoop</tt> with the parameter <tt>"Herbert"</tt>.  If you would like 
to call the function again, you type the name of the function with the desired
parameters, at the shell prompt.



<p> With the remaining time, work on the homework problems.

<h3>Using Python on Your Computer</h3>

The Python programming language and IDLE environment are freely available
for many platforms from <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>.  
For this class, we are using <b>Python 3</b>.  Many features of the language
(including the syntax of <tt>print</tt> statements) changed between the second and third
version, so, you must use the Python 3 for submitting programs.
