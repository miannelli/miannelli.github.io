<h3>Working With Files</h3>


<p>Python has many built-in functions for working with strings and files 
(<a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">string
methods</a>).  In this lab, we will manipulate files using various string methods.

<p>
Let's start with the program <tt>printfile.py</tt> from the book's website.  Try 
running it.  When it asks for a file, type in printfile.py.  What does it print out?

<p> Next, let's try it on the file <a href="allcaps.txt">allcaps.txt</a>.
Let's change the print line to 
<pre>
	print(data.lower())
</pre>
What happens?  Why?

<p>
To print to a file (instead of to the screen) is very easy:
<ul>
	<li> Open a file for writing
	<li> Add <tt>file=outFileName</tt> to your print statements.
</ul>

<p>Let's do that for the <tt>printfile.py</tt> program:
<pre>
def main():
    fname = input("Enter filename: ")
    infile = open(fname,"r")
    outfile = open("out.txt","w")
    data = infile.read()
    print(data, file=outfile)
</pre>
Run the program.  Where did it send the output?  Modify this program so that all
the output is in <i>lowercase</i> and test it on the text file above.

<p>
In python, there's often many different ways to write the same program.  Let's 
write a program that prints the lines of a file using a for loop:
<pre>
def main():
    print("This program prints a file.")

    # get the input file name
    infileName = input("Please enter name of input file: ")

    # open the files:
    infile = open(infileName, "r")

    # read each line of the input file and print it to outfile
    #   
    for line in infile:
        print(line)

main()
</pre>

What happens when you run this program?  Why is it doublespacing the output?  
When you read a line from a file, it ends with an enter or `newline' character
(often represented as <tt>`\n'</tt>.  We can solve this in several different
ways.  One way to keep the last character of a line
from being printed, we can use the slice operator to truncate the string:
<pre>
	print(line[:-1], file = outfile)
</pre>
The slice, <tt>line[:-1]</tt> says that you would like the string that consists
of all the characters in <tt>line</tt> up to but not including the last character
(since the -1 index always refers to the last character of a string, no matter
how long the string is).

<p>Modify this second program to print out the file all lowercase and
singlespaced, and test it.

<h3>Finding Errors</h3>

Finding, and fixing errors, in your programs is a very useful skill.  Let's look at a program with lots of errors and work through how to identify the issues and fix them.  The program, <a href="errors.py">errors.py</a>, when loaded into IDLE does not run:
<pre># errors.py is based on dateconvert2.py from Chapter 5 of the Zelle textbook
#     Converts day month and year numbers into two date formats

def main()
    # get the day month and year
    day, month year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")

    date1 = str(month)"/"+str(day)+"/"+str(year)

    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", 
              "May", "June", "July", "August", 
              "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    monthStr = months[month+1]
    date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)

    print("The date is" date1, "or", date2+".")

main()
</pre>
Instead, a dialog box pops up and says "invalid syntax":<br>
<br>
<img src="errorWindow1.jpg">
<br>

<p>The red line indicates where the intepreter has found an error.  Can you tell what it is?  Syntax is another word for grammar, so, it most likely missing `punctuation' or a misspelling of some sort.  We have spelled <tt>def</tt> correctly and have the right number of parenthesis, so, what else is missing?

<p>The answer is after the parenthesis on a function definition, a colon is required.  Add that in:
<pre>
    def main():
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="errorWindow2.jpg"><br>
<br>Instead of the whole line being highlighted, only the word <tt>year</tt> is.  The Python intepreter was not expecting <tt>year</tt> and says there is a grammatical mistake.  Since <tt>year</tt> does not include any grammatical constructs, we need to look <i>before</i> the message to see where the error is.  
Do you see it?

<p>The answer is lists of variables need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre>
    day, month, year = ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Once more we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="errorWindow3.jpg"><br>

<p>It has highlighted the first item, <tt>date1</tt> on the line.  That is a name and looks fine.  So, as above, let's look before the highlighted error to see if there's a problem.  The line above it is:
<pre>
    day, month, year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")
</pre>
It did not highlight this line, so, the problem must be at the end.  Do you see it?  

<p>The answer is we are missing a closing parenthesis.  The line has two left parenthesis but only one right parenthesis.  Add the right parenthesis in:
<pre>
    ... and year numbers: "))
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="errorWindow4.jpg"><br>

<p>The intepreter does not understand the second " on the line.  Why?  What is this line doing?  It's constructing a string and storing it in the variable <tt>date1</tt>.  How do you build a string out of smaller strings?

<p>The answer is to put smaller strings together (called concatenation) we need to use the plus sign (+).  The line is missing a plus sign right before the quotes.  Add the plus sign in:
<pre>
    date1 = str(month) + "/" ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box, but this one has a different message:<br><br>
<img src="errorWindow5.jpg"><br>

<p><tt>EOL</tt> means "End of the line", so, the message says that the end of the line was reached before you finished defining the string.  How can you fix this?

<p>The answer is to end the string, using quotation marks.  The line is missing a quotation mark at the very end.  Add the quotation mark :
<pre>
    ...+ ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Our familiar dialog box returns:<br><br>
<img src="errorWindow6.jpg"><br>

<p>We have seen this type of error before.  How do you fix it?

<p>The answer is lists of arguments need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre>
    ... date is", date1 ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It runs!  Now let's make sure it works.  Type in at the prompt:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
</pre>
Uh oh, instead of output, we get the following messages:
<pre style = "color: red">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 18, in <module>
    main()
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 13, in main
    monthStr = months[month+1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
<p>When you see messages like this, go to the very last line:
<pre style = "color: red">
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
It says that the index for our list is out of range.  An index is the item of the list that we're accessing.  For example, <tt>months[1]</tt> has index <tt>1</tt> and will give us <tt>February</tt>.  The range of the index for a list is <tt>0</tt> to one less than the length of the list.  In the case of <tt>months</tt>, the range is <tt>[0,1,2,...,11]</tt>.  What went wrong when we entered <tt>12</tt> for our month?  


<p>The answer is we used <tt>month+1 = 12 + 1 = 13</tt> as the index:
<pre>
    monthStr = months[month+1]
</pre>
which is out of range.  What do we want instead?  Instead of adding <tt>1</tt>, we should subtract <tt>1</tt>.  Change it in the program:
<pre>
    monthStr = months[month-1]
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It still runs, but does it work?  Let's try the same input again:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
The date is 12/31/14 or December 31,  + str(year).
</pre>

<p>Something odd is happening at the end-- <tt>str(year)</tt> does not look right.  Let's look at the print statement:
<pre>
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
The intepreter is treating <tt>",  + str(year)"</tt> as a string (instead of evaluating <tt>str(year)</tt>), so, we must have put the quotation mark in the wrong place before.  Let's move it:
<pre>
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ","  + str(year)
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Success!  But try a few other inputs, just to make sure.  It is always good to try cases that are near the `boundary' of what's allowed, since those are the places we are most likely to make mistakes:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1,1,2015
The date is 1/1/2015 or January 1,2015.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1, 2, 2003
The date is 2/1/03 or February 1,2003.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 4, 7, 1976
The date is 7/4/1976 or July 4,1976.
</pre>

<p>We have removed all the errors, and the program now runs correctly!
