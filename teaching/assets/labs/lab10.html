<h3>Mystery Point Game</h3>

<p>Today, we are going to write a simple game where the user tries to find our mystery
point in the graphics window.  Lets first go through the <a href="mysteryPoint.py">program</a>
section by section:

<ul>
	<li> Opening comments and importing modules:  In addition to <tt>math</tt> and <tt>graphics</tt>,
		we will also need to generate random numbers (to put our point at a random location), so, 
		we have also included that module:
<pre>
# Mystery point game for Lab 9
# Lehman College, CUNY, Fall 2012

from graphics import *
from math import *
from random import *
</pre>

	<li> We will reuse the distance function from the previous lab:
<pre>
# Reuse the distance function we wrote for Lab 8:
def dist(p1,p2):
    dist = sqrt((p1.getX()-p2.getX())**2 + (p1.getY() - p2.getY())**2)
    return dist

</pre>
	<li> Set up the graphics window:
<pre>
def main():
    w = GraphWin("Target Practice",500,500)
    w.setCoords(-250,-250,250,250)
</pre>
	<li> We will use the built-in random number generator to give 
	coordinates for our mystery points.  See Chapter 9 for more discussion 
	on random numbers:
<pre>
    #Generate a mystery point (at a random location):
    x = randrange(-200,200)
    y = randrange(-200,200)
    print("x and y are:",x,y)
    mysteryPoint = Point(x,y)
</pre>
	<li> Set up a <tt>Text</tt> object to display messages to the user.  We changed the font size,
	since the default one is small and hard to read.
<pre>
    #Text to tell the user what's happening:
    t = Text(Point(0,-210), "Click on the mystery point")
    t.setSize(16)
    t.draw(w)
</pre>
	<li> Save the point that the user clicked in the variable <tt>p</tt>.  We display its distance
	to our mystery point in the IDLE shell:
<pre>
    #Get the point:
    p = w.getMouse()
    p.draw(w)
    d = dist(mysteryPoint, p)
    print("distance from mystery point is:", d)
</pre>
	<li>  This loop repeats as long as the condition <tt>d > 20</tt> holds.  So, once the point
	clicked is within 20 of the mystery point, the loop ends.  You can make the game harder
	(or easier) by decreasing (or increasing) 20.  For example, if you change the 20 to 10, then 
	the user has to click even closer to the mystery point to win.  If you change the 20 to 100, 
	then the game becomes much easier since they only have to be within 100 to win.
<pre>
    #Keep going until they click close to the point:
    while d > 20:
        t.setText("Missed! Please click again!")
        p = w.getMouse()
        p.draw(w)
        d = dist(mysteryPoint, p)
        print("distance from mystery point is:", d)
</pre>
	<li> Congratulate the user for finding the point and end the program nicely:
<pre>
    t.setText("Congratulations!  You found the mystery point!")

    #keep the window up until the user clicks
    w.getMouse()
    w.close()

main()
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Try running the program.  How easy is it to win?

<h3>Giving Hints</h3>

<p>Could you find the point without peeking at the IDLE shell?  To make
the game a bit easier, we will add hints.  The first hint will be to tell
the user if they need to click more to the left (or right) to find the 
point.  Here is the pseudocode:
<pre>
	if point clicked is to the left of mystery point
		give message "Too far left"
	else 
		give message "Too far right"
</pre>
How can you tell if the point clicked is to the left of the mystery point?
The x-coordinate tells how far left or right a point is, so, we compare
the x-coordinates of the two points:
<pre>
        if p.getX() < mysteryPoint.getX():
            t.setText("Click again! You were too far left")
        else:
            t.setText("Click again! You were too far right")
</pre>


<p>Now, add in the code that will give a hint to move up (or down) 
depending on where they clicked with respect to the mystery point.
Your completed program should have a "left/right" hint and an "low/high"
hint to make the game possible to do without looking at our diagonostics
on the python shell.

<p>
Hint:  Before the loop, set up another <tt>Text</tt> object, <tt>t2</tt> to display
the message about being too low or too high:
<pre>
    t2 = Text(Point(0,-230), "")
    t2.setSize(16)
    t2.draw(w)
</pre>


</ul>

<h3>Finding Errors, II</h3>

<p>In <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a>, we looked at some common syntax errors and how to fix them.  Most of those errors were missing punctuation (such at colons, quotes, or plus signs).  Let's look at a few more errors that occur when using conditionals, loops, and functions:

<pre>
# errors2.py-- modified from Zelle
# recursions.py
#   A collection of simple recursive functions from Zelle, 2nd Edition
#   (Some also include looping counterparts).

def fact(n)
    # returns factorial of n
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else
        return n * fact(n-1

def reverse(s):
    # returns reverse of string s
    if s == "":
        return s
    elif:
        return reverse(s[1:]) + s[0]

def anagrams(s):
    # returns a list of all anagrams of string s
    if s == "":
        return [s]
    else:
        ans = []
        for w in anagrams(s[1:]):
            for pos in range(len(w)+1):
                    ans.append(w[:pos]+s[0]+w[pos:])
        return ans

def loopFib(n):
    # returns the nth Fibonacci number
    curr = 1
        prev = 1
    for i in range(n-2):
        curr, prev = curr+prev, curr
    return curr

def main():
    n = eval(input("Enter a number: "))
    s = input("Enter a string: ")
    print(n+"!= ", fact(n), "or, loopFig(n))
    print(s, "reversed is: ", reverse(s))
    print("\n anagrams: ", anagrams(s))

main()

</pre>

<p>Load the program into IDLE and run the program.  A dialog box pops up and says "invalid syntax":<br>
<br>
<img src="errors2Window1.jpg">
<br>
<p>
We have seen this one before, it's a missing colon (":") at the end of the function definition.  Add it in and run again.
<br>
<img src="errors2Window2.jpg">
<br>
<p>
Again, we get an invalid syntax.  What's wrong here?  (Hint: same as the last one).  Fix the error, and let's run the program again:
<br>
<img src="errors2Window3.jpg">
<br>
<p>
This one is different.  IDLE has highlighted the word <tt>def</tt>, and yet that seems to spelled correctly.  A general rule to follow: if you do not see an error on the current line, look above (usually for missing quotes or closing parenthesis).  On the previous line, the function call to <tt>fact()</tt> is missing the closing parenthesis.  Add it, and run the program again:
<br>
<img src="errors2Window4.jpg">
<br>
<p>
This one is a bit harder-- all the keywords are spelled correctly and there's no missing colons, parenthesis, or quotes.  What's wrong?  Python expected the word <tt>else</tt> (<tt>elif</tt> is only used when you need multiple tests in multi-way decision).  Replace <tt>elif</tt> with <tt>else</tt> and try again:
<br>
<img src="errors2Window5.jpg">
<br>
<p>
The message says:  <tt>unexpected indent</tt>.  The line does seem to be indented for no reason (i.e. it's not part of a block of code in a loop or decision construct).  Remove the extra indent and continue:
<br>
<img src="errors2Window6.jpg">
<br>
<p>
This is a common error.  In plain English, it means that the end of the line ("EOL") was reached before the string finished.  In other words, the string is missing its ending quotes.  Add it in (right after the word <tt>or</tt>) and run the program again.  

<p>It now compiles!  But we need to test it to make sure no run-time errors remain:
<br>
<img src="errors2Window7.jpg">
<br>
<p>
When reading the traceback message (all the red text), go to the very last line and see what it says.  The message says we cannot use <tt>+</tt> for <tt>'int'</tt> and <tt>'string'</tt>.  We only used <tt>+</tt> once in the line to concatenate <tt>n</tt> to a string.  Since we want <tt>n</tt> to eventually be a string and printed to the screen, let's change it to a string (by using the <tt>str()</tt> function):
<pre>
print(str(n)+"!= ", fact(n), "or", loopFig(n))
</pre>
<p>
Running it again, a new run-time errors appears:
<br>
<img src="errors2Window8.jpg">
<br>
<p>
The message says that IDLE cannot find <tt>loopFig()</tt>.  Scanning through the file, it looks we misspelled it!  The function is called <tt>loopFib()</tt>.  Fix the misspelling in the <tt>main()</tt> and try again...
<br>
<img src="errors2Window9.jpg">
<br>
<p>
Success!  The program accepted input, processed it, and outputted it to the screen.  Try with a couple of different inputs to test how it works.
