<h3>Graphing functions with functions</h3>

<p>Since our first day of class, we have been using functions.  This chapter revisits
functions in more depth.  In python, we indicate a function by following a name with parenthesis.  
For example, <tt>print()</tt> and <tt>main()</tt> are examples of functions.  The <tt>print()</tt>
is a built-in function in python, while the <tt>main()</tt> function is one that we write.

<p> 
To define a function, we say:
<pre>
	def functionName(anyInputsGoHere):
		<the body of the function goes here>
</pre>

<p>
Let's write a program that defines multiple functions.  Start your program with the following:
<pre>
# Demonstration program to graph function entered by user.
# Prof. Melvin Fitting
# October 24, 2011

from graphics import *
from math import *

def main():
	print("This program will graph a function...")
	#Get user data
	#Set up window
	#Graph the function
	#Close the window
	
	
main()
</pre>

We've set up an outline, in comments for our program.  Let's fill in each part
with a function.   To make our main program easier to read, we will use functions,
each of which does one part of the program. We will give our functions descriptive names
so by reading through the main function we have an idea of what the program does.  

<p> We first need to get user data, so, let's make a function called <tt>getUserData()</tt>.
It will take no input (also called parameters) but will need to return the data the
user entered.  

<pre>
# Demonstration program to graph function entered by user.
# Prof. Melvin Fitting
# October 24, 2011

from graphics import *
from math import *

def main():
	print("This program will graph a function...")
	#Get user data
	function, left, right, top, bottom = getUserData()
	#Set up window
	#Graph the function
	#Close the window

def getUserData():
    print("This program graphs an arbitrary math function.")
    print("You must enter the x and y ranges to be displayed.")
    left = eval(input("Enter x coordinate for left edge of window: "))
    right = eval(input("Enter x coordinate for right edge of window: "))
    bottom = eval(input("Enter y coordinate for lower edge of window: "))
    top = eval(input("Enter y coordinate for upper edge of window: "))
    function = input("Enter function expression to be graphed, with x as variable: ")
    return function, left, right, top, bottom	
	
main()
</pre>

What happens when you run this program?  The <tt>main()</tt> function is called first.
It prints the message, <tt>This program ...</tt> and then calls the <tt>getUserData()</tt>
function.  The <tt>getUserData()</tt> function is defined below the <tt>main()</tt> function.
It prints a message and then prompts the user for the coordinates of the window and 
the function that should be graphed.  Try running your program.  
Some inputs that you can use to test the program are:
<tt>0, 10, -100, 100, sin(x)*x**2</tt>.  Nothing much will happen yet, since all we have
done is asked for input.  

<p>
Let's add more to the program.  The next step is to set up the window.  Add to the
<tt>main()</tt> function:
<pre>
	win = setUpWindow(left, right, top, bottom, function)
</pre>
(this line should go right below the <tt>#Set up window</tt> comment).

<p>After the <tt>getUserData</tt>, add in the function definition for the function
that will set up a window:
<pre>
def setUpWindow(left, right, top, bottom, function):
    win = GraphWin("Graph of " + function, 500, 500)
    win.setCoords(left, bottom, right, top)
    Line(Point(left, 0), Point(right, 0)).draw(win)
    Line(Point(0, bottom), Point(0, top)).draw(win)
    return win
</pre>

<p>Take a look at you program before you run it.  When you type <tt>main()</tt>, it calls (or
`invokes') the function <tt>main()</tt>.  Inside <tt>main()</tt>, a message is printed, then 
there is a call to <tt>getUserData()</tt> function which returns 5 values that are assigned
to the variables, <tt>function, left, right, top, bottom</tt>.  The next line calls the function 
<tt>setUpWindow()</tt>.  <tt>setUpWindow()</tt> takes 5 input parameters and creates a window
object, <tt>win</tt>.

<p>Looking at the <tt>main()</tt> function, there are still two last items to fill out in
our outline of comments:
<pre>
    #Graph the function
    drawGraph(win, function, left, right)
    #Close the window
    win.getMouse()
    win.close()
</pre>
We need to add in a definition for the function <tt>drawGraph()</tt>
<pre>
def drawGraph(win, function, left, right):
    increment = (right-left)/100
    x = left
    rightPoint = Point(x, eval(function))
    for n in range(100):
        leftPoint = rightPoint
        x += increment
        rightPoint = Point(x, eval(function))
        Line(leftPoint, rightPoint).draw(win)
</pre>        
Add this function definition after the one for <tt>setUpWindow()</tt>.  We now have a complete
program that makes multiple function calls.  Try running it with 
the inputs:  <tt>0, 10, -100, 100, sin(x)*x**2</tt>.  

<p>Here's an overview of what happens when you run this program:
<ol>
	<li>  When you type <tt>main()</tt> function, the statements in the body of the function 
		are executed one after another.
	<li> First it prints a message to the screen.
	<li> Next, it calls <tt>getUserData()</tt> which asks the user for data to draw a window
		and what function should be graphed.  These are returned to the <tt>main()</tt> and 
		stored in the variables <tt>function, left, right, top, bottom</tt>.
	<li> Next, using the variables <tt>function, left, right, top, bottom</tt> as inputs, we
		call the <tt>setUpWindow()</tt> function which creates a window and returns it to 
		the <tt>main()</tt> function.
	<li> Next, we call the <tt>drawGraph()</tt> function.  It takes 4 inputs:  the window we're
		drawing on, 
		the function to be drawn, and the left and right range of the window.  This method 
		draws the function by breaking it down into 100 short intervals, and drawing a line 
		across each interval.  The x coordinate starts at the left side, and goes up by 1/100's
		of the width each time.  The y coordinate is the value of the function at each value of
		x.
</ol>
