<p>
This lab builds a simple class for billiard balls, using the built-in turtle library.
</div>


<div>
As the class has progressed, 
we have been using classes and objects that others have written.  For example, 
Zelle (the author of our textbook) defined a series of classes for graphics (that
reside in graphics.py file).  In today's lab, we will define our own class and 
instantiate objects for it.   

<p>
We're going to write a simple class to represent billiard (pool) balls that
bounce off the boundary edges (i.e. the edges of the billiard table).  For this
simple class, we will focus on just single objects and not the interaction between
them (or multitasking-- it's beyond the scope of this course but will be covered
next semester).

<p>
In the image below is an example of a billiard ball in action.  the billiard
ball is blue with boundaries of the bounding box of (-200,-200) to (200,200).  The
ball started at the center pointed in a random direction and travelled for 400 
iterations, bouncing off boundary walls when it encountered them:

<img src="tBall.jpg" height = 400>

<p>
Here is the <tt>main()</tt> program:
<pre>
def main():
    setUpTable(-200,-200,400)

    b1 = TurtleBall("blue",random()*360,-200,-200,200,200)
    b1.move(400)

    turtle.Screen().exitonclick()
main()

</pre>
The function <tt>setUpTable</tt> draws the boundaries of the billiard table 
to the screen given the minimal x and y coordinates and the length of the
sides.  <tt>b1</tt> is an object of our new class <tt>turtleBall</tt>.


<p>
Before we go into the details of the class:
<ol>
	<li> Download the <a href="turtleBall.py">class file</a> and the 
	<a href="testTurtleBall.py">main file</a> and run them (they are also
	included below if you have troubles downloading them).
	
	<li> Experiment with the program by adding a new object, <tt>b2</tt> 
	to the main program that has a billiard ball that is green:
	
	<pre>
    b2 = TurtleBall("green",random()*360,-100,-100,100,100)
    b2.move(400)	
	</pre>
	
	And run your program.  What happens?  Why does it only cover part of 
	the screen?  What is different from the definition of <tt>b1</tt> and
	<tt>b2</tt>?
	
	<li> Add a third billiard ball that bounces outside of table drawn
	to the screen.
</ol>

<p>
Our class will have instance variables (to keep track of properties of each object)
and methods (functions that can be applied to the objects).  For instance variables, 
we will use a turtle to keep track of the location and color.  For methods, we
need to write a constructor method (called <tt>__init__</tt> in Python) that creates
new objects of the class.  Note that in our main program, we invoke a class method
called <tt>move()</tt> that moves the billiard ball around the screen.


Now, let's look at the class definition in detail.  In Python, classes begin
with the keyword, <tt>class</tt>:
<pre>
#A simple class, demonstrating constructors and methods in python
#Intro Programming, Lehman College, CUNY, Spring 2014
from turtle import *

class TurtleBall:
</pre>
Classes contain constructor methods that are used to create new objects.
Constructors are always called <tt>__init__</tt> and all methods in a
class have as their first parameter the object itself (traditionally 
called <tt>self</tt>).  Our class has two constructors.  The first one
has input parameters of the object itself, the starting color and angle,
and the boundaries for where it can go.  It then creates a turtle (called
<tt>self.turtle</tt>) as an instance variable, as well as 4 instance
variables for storing the bounding box of the boundary
(<tt>self.xMin</tt>, <tt>self.yMin</tt>, <tt>self.xMax</tt>, and 
<tt>self.yMax</tt>):
<pre>
    def __init__(self,color,angle,x1,y1,x2,y2):
        self.turtle = Turtle()
        self.turtle.color(color)
        self.turtle.shape("circle")
        self.turtle.left(angle)
        self.turtle.speed(0)
        self.xMin,self.yMin,self.xMax,self.yMax = x1,y1,x2,y2
</pre>
The second constructor is for when we are lazy and do not want to specify
the angle or boundaries.  Instead, it takes as input parameters just the
color and calls the first <tt>__init__</tt> method with a starting angle
of 45 degrees and a boundary with bounding box of (-100,-100) and (100,100).
<pre>
    def __init__(self,color):
        __init(self,color,45,-100,-100,100,100)        
</pre>
Python decides which of these two methods to call based on the number
of input parameters.  If you call it with 6 actual parameters, it calls
the first.  If you call it with 1 parameter, it calls the second.  If you 
call it with any other number of parameters, it will fill the Python shell
with red text and give an error.

<p>The most interesting part of our class is the <tt>move()</tt> method.
It moves the turtle <tt>d*5</tt> steps, where <tt>d</tt> is specified
as an input parameter.  At each iteration, it checks to see if the turtle
is in bounds.  If it is not and close to the x boundaries, it turns 
<tt>180-2*angle</tt> to the left.  If it is close to the y boundaries, it turns
<tt>360-2*angle</tt> to the left.  In both cases, <tt>angle</tt> is the
direction it is currently moving, and the amount to turn was calculated
using similar triangles (from high school geometry):
<pre>
    def move(self,d):
        for i in range(d):
            x,y = self.turtle.pos()
            angle = self.turtle.heading()
            if (x > self.xMax-4 or x < self.xMin+4)\
               and (y > self.yMax-4 or y < self.yMin+4):
                self.turtle.left(180)
            elif x > self.xMax-4 or x < self.xMin+4:
                self.turtle.left(180-2*angle)
            elif y > self.yMax-4 or y < self.yMin+4:
                self.turtle.left(360-2*(angle))
            self.turtle.forward(5)
</pre>
Our last two methods allow you to get and set the turtle variable:
<pre>
    def getTurtle(self):
        return self.turtle

    def setTurtle(self, value):
        self.turtle = turtle
</pre>


Next, try adding two methods to the class.  Your new methods should
be called, <tt>getColor()</tt> and <tt>setColor()</tt> and they should
get and set, respectively, the color of the turtle.  Modify your 
main program to test that your new methods work.
