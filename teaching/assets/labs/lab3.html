<h3>Bouncing Ball</h3>

<p>Included with the textbook is a <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/">simple graphics
library</a>.  To use it, place the file <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py">graphics.py</a>
to the directory where you saved your python files.  There is a useful <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf">cheat sheet</a>
of the graphics functions.

<p>
Here is the first program (inspired from <a href="http://www.motionscript.com/mastering-expressions/simulation-basics-1.html">motionscript.com</a>):
<pre>
#Idea from:  http://www.motionscript.com/mastering-expressions/simulation-basics-1.html

from math import *
from graphics import *
from time import *

def goodSine():
    veloc = .5  #horizontal velocity (pixels per second)
    amp = 50    #sine wave amplitude (pixels)
    freq = .01  #oscillations per second

    #Set up a graphics window:
    win = GraphWin("Good Sine Waves",400,200)
    win.setCoords(0.0, -100.0, 200.0, 100.0)

    #Draw a line for the x-axis:
    p1 = Point(0,0)
    p2 = Point(200,0)
    xAxis = Line(p1,p2)
    xAxis.draw(win)

    #Draw a ball that follows a sine wave
    for time in range(1000):
        x = time*veloc
        y = amp*sin(freq*time*2*pi)
        ball = Circle(Point(x,y),2)
        ball.draw(win)
        sleep(0.1)  #Needed so that animation runs slowly enough to be seen


    win.getMouse()
    win.close()

    
goodSine()
</pre>
Save this file to your USB or MyDocuments folder (along with <tt>graphics.py</tt>) and run the 
program.  Let's go through what each part does:
<ul>
	<li>	<pre>
from math import *
from graphics import *
from time import *
</pre>
	The <tt>import</tt> statement asks python to include the functions from a given module, or 
	collection of functions.  These three <tt>import</tt> statements ask for the functions from 
	the math, graphics, and time modules.  The math and time modules are built-in to python; the 
	graphics module was written by Zelle, the textbook's author.
	<li>	<pre>
    veloc = .5  #horizontal velocity (pixels per second)
    amp = 50    #sine wave amplitude (pixels)
    freq = .01  #oscillations per second
</pre>
	These three variables control the speed, height, and bounce of the ball.  Try changing them 
	and see what happens to the animation.  Your goal is to have the ball touch the ceiling every
	time.

	<li>	<pre>
    #Set up a graphics window:
    win = GraphWin("Good Sine Waves",400,200)
    win.setCoords(0.0, -100.0, 200.0, 100.0)
</pre>
	These lines set up the graphics window.  This window will have the title, "Good Sine Waves" and
	width 400 pixels and height 200 pixel.  A pixel is just one tiny light bulb in your computer's
	screen.  So, 400 pixels is 400 tiny lights in the screen.  You can assume that computers
	have screens that are at least 800 by 600 pixels.  In the graphics module, there is a function
	for changing the coordinates of a graphics window.  We did so here to make the math calculating
	the height of the bouncing ball easier.

	<li>	<pre>
    #Draw a line for the x-axis:
    p1 = Point(0,0)
    p2 = Point(200,0)
    xAxis = Line(p1,p2)
    xAxis.draw(win)
</pre>
	The graphics module has several standard shapes (see <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics/index.html">list
	of graphics objects</a>).  We created two points, called <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>, that will
	be the endpoints of a line called <tt>xAxis</tt>.  For our line to be seen, we need to draw
	it to our window (which we called <tt>win</tt>).  Since it is possible to have multiple windows
	in a given program, we need to include the name of our window as the input to the draw function.

	<li>	<pre>
    #Draw a ball that follows a sine wave
    for time in range(1000):
        x = time*veloc
        y = amp*sin(freq*time*2*pi)
        ball = Circle(Point(x,y),2)
        ball.draw(win)
        sleep(0.1)  #Needed so that animation runs slowly enough to be seen
</pre>
	This loop repeats the indented statements 1000 times.  First time through the variable <tt>time</tt>
	is 0; the next time through it is 1; and it keeps going until <tt>time</tt> is 999.  Each repetition
	of the loop sets the variable <tt>x</tt> to a multiple of <tt>time</tt> and sets the variable <tt>y</tt>
	to the <tt>sine</tt> of a multiple of <tt>time</tt>.  It then makes a circle centered at <tt>(x,y)</tt>
	and draws that circle (called <tt>ball</tt>) to the window.  Lastly, we have a call to the sleep
	function so that the animation runs slowly enough so we can see it.
	<li>	<pre>
    win.getMouse()
    win.close()
</pre>
	We add these lines at the end of our graphics programs to keep the window open.  The first 
	command is waiting for a mouse click.  After the mouse is clicked in the window, the next 
	statement is executed, <tt>win.close()</tt> which closes the window.
	<li>	<pre>
goodSine()
</pre>
	This is a call (or invocation) of the function <tt>goodSine()</tt> that we just wrote.  It is 
	not necessary to have in your file, but if you do, you do not have to type <tt>goodSine()</tt>
	in the Python shell to run your function.  Instead, it will be called when you use the F5 key.
</ul>

<p>
To make the ball appear to bounce, we need for it to stay above the line representing the x-axis.
Another way of saying that is its y-coordinate should always be positive.  A simple way to do 
that is to take the absolute value of the expression for the y variable:
<pre>
        y = abs(amp*sin(freq*time*2*pi))
</pre>
Try running your program to see the bouncing ball!
