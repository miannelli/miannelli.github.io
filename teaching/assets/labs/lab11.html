Today's lab focuses on an application of nested loops: sorting lists of numbers.

<h3>Nesting Loops and Conditionals</h3>

In Chapters 7 and 8, we  discussed loops and decisions (also called conditionals)
in detail.  Many applications can be programmed by simply combining these two 
concepts.  In today's lab, we will look at two different ways to sort lists of 
numbers (described in more detail in Chapter 13 of the textbook).  

<p>The basic idea of a sorting algorithm is to take a list of items (we'll focus
on whole numbers, but you can sort just about anything that you can measure) and
return the list in order.  So, for example, if you were given as input the 
list:
<pre>
[3, 8, 23, 2, 4, 9, 45, 1]
</pre>
the result of sorting the numbers (in increasing order) would be:
<pre>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 23, 45]
</pre>


<p>There are many different approaches to sorting.  Here's the idea 
for the <b>selectionSort</b> algorithm:
<ul>
	<li> find the smallest number in the list and move to the front,
	<li> repeat the first step on the last part of the list (i.e. lst[1:0])
</ul>
So, continuing our example, we would have:
<pre>
[3, 8, 23, 2, 4, 9, 45, 1]   <-- starting list
[1, 3, 8, 23, 2, 4, 9, 45]   <-- selected 1 and moved it to the front
[1, 2, 3, 8, 23, 4, 9, 45]   <-- selected 2 from remaining lst[1:] and moved it
[1, 2, 3, 8, 23, 4, 9, 45]   <-- selected 3 from lst[2:] but already in place
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 23, 9, 45]   <-- selected 4 from lst[3:] and moved it
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 23, 9, 45]   <-- selected 8 from lst[4:] but already in place
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 23, 45]   <-- selected 9 from lst[5:] and moved it
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 23, 45]   <-- selected 23 from lst[6:] but already in place
</pre>

The python code (from the book's Chapter 13) is:
<pre>
def selSort(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    for bottom in range(n-1):
        mp = bottom
        for i in range(bottom+1,n):
            if lst[i] < lst[mp]:
                mp = i
        lst[bottom], lst[mp] = lst[mp], lst[bottom]
</pre>
Note the nested loops:  
<ul>
	<li> the inner loop and decision statement find the smallest number (not 
		already in place), and 
	<li> the outer loop repeatedly goes through the remaining list until there
		are no more to put in order.
</ul>


<h3>Sorting Visualization</h3>

To make it easier to see the sorting, we have a visualization in 
<a href="sortGUI2.py">sortGUI2.py</a> file to your machine and
run it (if it doesn't load, the complete version is available at the bottom of
this file).  Since it uses Zelle's graphics,  
it will need the <tt>graphics.py</tt> file in the same directory.

<p>
The program generates 10 random numbers (and pauses, waiting for a mouse click)
and first sorts the list with 
the <b>selectionSort</b> algorithm from above.  The code has been modified 
slightly from the book to update the graphics display as it runs.
When the program runs, it repeatedly traverses the list.  On its first 
traversal of the list, it finds the smallest number and then interchanges it
with the first number in the list.  It then repeats looking for the next 
smallest number and puts that in the second position in the list.
It keeps going putting the next largest number in its place until the whole
list is sorted.  Run the program several times, paying attention to the 
first sort only.  Can you see the smallest number moving each time?



<h3>BubbleSort</h3>

Today, we are going to implement another sort, called <b>bubbleSort</b>.
While bubbleSort is not the most efficient way to sort big lists (
<a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8">President 
Obama on the subject</a>, 
<a href="http://overstated.net/2008/02/11/obama-not-bubble-sort">comments</a>), it is easy 
to understand.

<p>Algorithms are often written in <b>pseudo-code,</b> which is an 
informal, high-level description:
<pre>
func bubblesort( var a as array )
    for i from 2 to N
        for j from 0 to N - 2
           if a[j] > a[j + 1]
              swap( a[j], a[j + 1] )
end func
</pre>
(from <a href="http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Bubble_sort">www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Bubble_sort</a>)

<p>
Let's translate this line-by-line into python:
<ul>
	<li>
<pre>
func bubblesort( var a as array )
    for i from 2 to N
        for j from 0 to N - 2
           if a[j] > a[j + 1]
              swap( a[j], a[j + 1] )
end func
</pre>	
	<li>
<pre>
func bubblesort( var a as array )
</pre>	
This first lines says we have a function with an array variable called <tt>a</tt>.
In python, we define functions with the <tt>def</tt> keyword:
<pre>
	def bubbleSort(a):
</pre>
	<li>
<pre>
    for i from 2 to N
</pre>	
This next line is a <tt>for</tt> loop, but what is <tt>N</tt>?  Usually, <tt>N</tt>
or <tt>n</tt> refers to the length of the list, so, let's set that up as a variable
first, then write out the for loop:
<pre>
	N = len(a)
	for i in range(2, N+1):
</pre>
Note that their for loop goes from 0 upto and including N, so, we need to change
the range accordingly.

	<li>
<pre>
        for j from 0 to N - 2
</pre>	
Since we have <tt>N</tt> defined, we can easily write out this for-loop:
<pre>	
		for j in range(N-1):
</pre>

	<li>
<pre>
           if a[j] > a[j + 1]
</pre>	
We need one small addition to make this line proper python:
<pre>
		   if a[j] > a[j+1]:
</pre>
	<li>
<pre>
              swap( a[j], a[j + 1] )
</pre>	
Lastly, we need to swap the two values.  In python, we can do this in one line 
with simultaneous assignment:
<pre>
			  a[j],a[j+1] = a[j+1],a[j]
</pre>

</ul>

Putting this altogether, we have:
<pre>
	def bubbleSort(a):
		N = len(a)
		for i in range(2,N+1):
			for j in range(N-1):
				if a[j] > a[j+1]:
					a[j],a[j+1] = a[j+1],a[j]
</pre>


To make this function show the graphics, we will add two calls to the <tt>drawBox()</tt>
as well as to <tt>sleep()</tt> (to slow it down enough to see):
<pre>
def bubbleSort(lst,w):
    #n = len(lst)
    for j in range(n-1):
        for i in range(n-1):
            if lst[i] > lst[i+1]:
                # draw the bars that are to be swapped            
                drawMovingBars(lst, i, i+1, w)
                # swap the bars
                lst[i], lst[i+1] = lst[i+1], lst[i]
                # draw the bars after they are swapped
                drawMovingBars(lst, i, i+1, w)
   
</pre>
Note that we need to add <tt>w</tt>, the graphics window variable,
to the formal parameters of our function
so that we can use it when calling our drawing function.


<p>Add the <tt>bubbleSort()</tt> above to your program and try running it.
Can you see the largest value "bubble" up to the top?  Try running the 
program multiple times to see the effect.
