<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description,
		contain a <tt>main()</tt> function and an invocation of the main at the end of the file:
		For example:
	<pre>
#Name: Herbert H. Lehman
#Date: September 4, 2013
#This program prints: hello world

def main():
	print("Hello world")
	
main()
	</pre>
<!--	<li> About one of every five submitted programs will be chosen, at random, for complete grading.	
-->
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<!--<li> Extra credit will be awarded for the programs that are chosen for complete grading 
	that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early, 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early, 2 extra credit points will be awarded. -->
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using Blackboard, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (15%
	of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all 
	incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>


<ol>
<a id="set1"></a>
	<li > <b>Due Date: 9 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapters 1 & 2</b><br>
		Write a program that prints your name to the screen 25 times.
	<li > <b>Due Date: 10 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapters 1 & 2</b><br>
		Modify the chaos program (available from the author's website) so that 
		it prints out 20 values instead of 10.		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 11 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapters 1 & 2</b><br>
		Choose a (printable) character from the keyboard.
		Write a program that prints an opening statement and then 
		asks the user for a number and prints your character that many times.
		
		<p>For example:
<pre>
The fault is in our stars...
Please enter a number:  2
*
*
</pre>
		<p>Another sample run:
<pre>
The fault is in our stars...
Please enter a number:  5
*
*
*
*
*
</pre>
		<p>Note:  your program should have a statement you like (different from the sample and
		unique to you, so that the cheat-checking program does not flag it as someone's work)
		and print a character you choose (again, different from the character chosen above).
	<li > <b>Due Date: 12 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapters 1 & 2</b><br>
		Write a program that converts weights measured in ounces to grams.
		One ounce is approximately 28.35 grams. <br>

		For example, if your first name is <tt>Eric</tt>, you would use <tt>Euros</tt>.  From
		the table above, we have that one dollar is worth 0.77 euros.
		You should begin the program by printing out your name.
		On each line, your program should write the number of dollars and the corresponding
		number of your currency.  For example:
		<pre>
Eric's converting program
		
Dollars:    Euros:
1           0.77
2           1.53
3           2.3
4           3.07
5           3.84
		</pre>
		Your program should print the information for 1, 2, ..., 10 dollars.  You do 
		not need to worry about formatting (we will talk about that more in Chapter 5), 
		but you do need to calculate all 10 entries.  <br>
		<i>Hint:  modify the second program from the <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.</i>


<a id="set2"></a>			
<hr>
	<li > <b>Due Date: 16 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for time in days and prints the number of years and days (assume that there are 365 days in a year).  
		For example, if	the user entered, 1000, your program would output, 
		<tt>2 years 270 days</tt>.
		Note that you should use "years" and "days" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect). 


	<li > <b>Due Date: 17 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for the diameter of a circular table and prints out the area.  For example, if the user enters <tt>10</tt>, your program should print out <tt>78.5398163397</tt>.
		<br><i>Hint:  The area of a circle is <tt>Pi*r*r</tt> where <tt>r</tt> is the radius of the circle.  The radius is half of the diameter.</i>

		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 18 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Built into Python is a module for simple drawing, called Turtle graphics.  To 
		use the Turtle graphics module, you must import it, just like with the math module.
		Some basic turtle commands are:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>left(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>right(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>forward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>backward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
		</ul>
		
		The following draws a 4-sided figure or square:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(4):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>
		
		Modify this program to draw a <b>8-sided figure or octagon</b>.  Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>

		<br><i>Hint:  The turtle rotates a total of 360 in forming the polygon.  For
		the square, the turtle turned 360/4 = 90 degrees.  Using the same reasoning, 
		how much should the turtle turn for an octogon?</i>

			<br>
		<i>Note:  Choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> turtle.py. 
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program11.py".
		</i>


	<li > <b>Due Date: 19 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Implement the following piece of pseudocode (i.e. directions that look very similar to code) as a complete program using turtle graphics:
<pre>
    Repeat 45 times:
        Walk forward 100 steps
        Turn right 92 degrees
</pre>
		Your output should look similar to:
		<br>
		<img src="spiral.jpg">
		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 22 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if your money decreased by 5% each year.  Your program should ask the user for the number of years and display
		the amount of money for each year.  The starting amount of money is $1000.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of years:  5
Year 0 : 950.0
Year 1 : 902.5
Year 2 : 857.375
Year 3 : 814.50625
Year 4 : 773.7809375</pre>	
	
		(Do not worry about formatting the amounts.  We will discuss how to do that well 
		in Chapter 5.)

<a id="set3"></a>
<hr>		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 23 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Modify the book's factorial program to calculate the <i>double factorial</i>.  
		The double factorial is similar to the factorial, except you multiply every other 
		number.  For example, <tt>5!! = 5 * 3 * 1</tt> and <tt>8!! = 8 * 6 * 4 * 2</tt>.
		Formally, <tt>n!! = n*(n-2)*(n-4)*...*(1)</tt>.<br>
		<i>Hint:  you only need to change the <tt>range</tt> statement.</i>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 29 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Modify the bouncing ball example from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a> so that the ball 
		bounces a little bit less each time.  At the end, it should appear to roll across the
		x-axis.  	
		<br>
		<i>Hint:  the only change needed is to the height of the ball.  How can
		you make the height get smaller as time increases?</i>



	<li > <b>Due Date: 30 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Using Zelle's graphics module, draw your initials-- the first letters of your 
		names.  Your display should contain at least 6 different objects (if the letters
		in your name can be displayed with less, add extra objects for decoration).
		
	
	<li > <b>Due Date: 1 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Using Zelle's graphics module, draw a house.  Your display should contain 3 or 
		more objects forming the
		house with roof, doors, and a window.  Use the <tt>Text</tt> object
		to include your name in the picture.
		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 2 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Modify the program <tt>triangle.py</tt> from the textbook (also available at the 
		author's website) to draw a small rectangle (instead of a point) at each point clicked by the user.


<a id="set4"></a>
<hr>
	<li > <b>Due Date: 3 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Write a program that takes two mouse clicks from the user and draws an oval whose bounding box corners include the two points clicked.




	<li > <b>Due Date: 6 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
 		Modify the bouncing ball problem (from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>) to 
		``wrap'' around the screen twice.  That is, when the ball gets to the right end of the 
		screen, have it continue on the left hand side.  
		<br><i>Hint:  use the remainder operator (%)
		to make sure that the x-coordinate is always between 0 and the width of the window.
		The default value for the <tt>veloc</tt> variable matches the periodicity (how often
		the function repeats itself).  If you change it to .49, it will be easier to see 
		the wrapping (since the ball won't be in the exact path same path the second time 
		through).</i>
	
	
	
	<li > <b>Due Date: 7 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Write a program that takes twenty mouse clicks from the user and draws a polygon
		whose corners, or vertices, are the clicked points.  
		<br>
		<i>Hint:  use the program you
		wrote for <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> and add a line from the last point clicked
		to the first point clicked.</i>



	

	<li > 
		<b>Due Date: 8 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints it out in all upper case and then all lower case.  
	Here is a sample run of the program: 
	<pre>Please enter a string:  Look behind, look here, look ahead
You entered (shouting):  LOOK BEHIND, LOOK HERE, LOOK AHEAD
But better (whispering): look behind, look here, look ahead
</pre>		

	<li > <b>Due Date: 9 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>		
		Implement the following piece of pseudocode as a complete program:
		
		<pre>
    1.  Prompt the user to enter a string and call it s.
    2.  Let l be the length of s.
    3.  For i from 0 upto l-1:
    4.     print s[i], s[l-1-i]
    5.  Print a closing statement
		</pre>
		Here is a sample run of the program:
		<pre>Enter string: a man a plan a canal panama
a a
  m
m a
a n
n a
  p

<hr>


	<li > <b>Due Date: 10 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>		
		Write a program that measures strings in terms of the length of your name.  For
		example, if your first name is "Kate", you would use the length of the string 
		"Kate" which is 4.  If your name is "Daniel", you would use the length 6.
		
		<p>Your program should print out <b>your name</b> to the screen and then ask the user
		to enter a string.  You should then print out how long the string is in terms of
		the length of your name (that is, the length of the user's string divided by
		your length).  For example,
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Kate"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 2.75 Kate's long.
		</pre>
	While, if your name was Daniel, your program would look like:
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Daniel"
Please enter a string:  Hello mom!
Your string is 1.8333 Daniel's long.
		</pre>		


			

	



		

		
		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 13 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Modify the <tt>encode.py</tt> program from <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>
		to use an offset entered by the user to encrypt the message.  The program in the lab encrypts each character by shifting 1 place ahead in the alphabet.  Your program should ask the user for the offset and encrypt their string by replacing each character by one that is <i>offset</i> places ahead in the alphabet.	
		<p>
		A sample of Caesar cipher disk (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>) with an offset of 13 (that is, every letter in plain text goes to one 13 letters to its right):<br>
		<img src="Ciphrdsk.gif"> 
	



					
	<li > <b>Due Date: 14 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for a list of prices of items purchased and 
		prints out each price and the total, formatted nicely. Here is a 
		sample run of the program:
		<pre >
Please enter the prices:  2.34, .99, 100, 81.05, 90
		
Your receipt:
         2.34
         0.99
       100.00
        81.05
        90.00
----------------
Total: 274.38	
		</pre>
		<i>Hint:  use the <tt>format()</tt> statement discussed in Chapter 5.</i>


		
			


	<li > <b>Due Date: 15 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>	
		Write a program that uses your full name and prints it to the screen, cycling
		through the string.  You must store your name in a string and use a loop to 
		print out the answer.  For example, if your name was "Herbert H. Lehman", the 
		print out would be:
		
<pre>
H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n
e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H
r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H e
b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H e r
e r t   H .   L e h m a n H e r b
r t   H .   L e h m a n H e r b e
t   H .   L e h m a n H e r b e r 
  H .   L e h m a n H e r b e r t 
H .   L e h m a n H e r b e r t   
.   L e h m a n H e r b e r t   H 
  L e h m a n H e r b e r t   H .  
L e h m a n H e r b e r t   H .   
e h m a n H e r b e r t   H .   L 
h m a n H e r b e r t   H .   L e 
m a n H e r b e r t   H .   L e h 
a n H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m 
n H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a
</pre>

		<i>Hint:  one way to approach this is to store the name with the spaces:
		<pre>"H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n"</pre></i>



	<li > <b>Due Date: 16 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>

	
		Make a list of at least 5 different places that you like to visit (these should
		be places that you would like to visit and not identical to others' lists or
		it will be picked up by the cheat-checking programs).  
		
		<p>
		Your program should print out the list regularly and vertically.  For example,
		<pre>
['San Francisco', 'Christchurch ', 'Sydney       ', 'Bangkok      ', 'Copenhagen   ']
S  C  S  B  C  
a  h  y  a  o  
n  r  d  n  p  
   i  n  g  e  
F  s  e  k  n  
r  t  y  o  h  
a  c     k  a  
n  h        g  
c  u        e  
i  r        n  
s  c           
c  h           
o   		</pre>
		
		<i>Hint:  if you have a list of strings, <tt>places</tt>, then <tt>places[0][i]</tt>
		refers to the ith character of the first word in your list.  Start by printing
		out the first place name vertically, then add in the others.
		</i>

<a id="set6"></a>				
<hr>	
	

	<li > <b>Due Date: 20 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>

		Write a program that asks the user for a name of a file and then prints to 
		the screen the number of characters and lines in the file.
		<br><i>Hint:  see <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6.</a></i>



	<li > <b>Due Date: 21 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>	
		Write a program that asks the user for a file containing a list of items to be completed
		and a name for an output file.  Your program should then write the list, with item numbers
		to the output file.  For example, if the input file is:
<pre>
Finish my Python homework.
Buy milk.
Do laundry.
Update webpage.
</pre>
		Then the output file would be:
<pre>
1.  Finish my Python homework.
2.  Buy milk.
3.  Do laundry.
4.  Update webpage.
</pre>	

	<li > <b>Due Date: 23 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file and a line length.
		Your program should then "wrap" all lines that are longer than line length,
		and print the result on the screen.
		For example, if the file contains:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789012345
This line has more than 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lots, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		and the user entered the length of 20, all lines longer than 20 would 
		be wrapped to the next line:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789
012345	
This line has more t
han 20 characters.
This one has less 

And this one has lot
s, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		<i>Hint:  break the problem in to parts:  first write a program that will print lines
		from a file to the screen (see <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6<a>).  Then modify 
		your initial program to only print lines up to the length entered.  And, to finish
		the program, then add in the code that prints lines that are longer than the length 
		entered.  Note you will have extra blank lines, if a short line is entered (we will discuss how to print different things depending on the length when we discuss 
		decisions in Chapter 7) and you do not have to worry about lines being longer than
		40 characters (i.e.  no need to wrap a line more than once).
		</i>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 19 November</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 7</b><br>
		The program <a href="turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="http://learn.code.org/s/1/level/23">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
		<ul>
			<li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward
			<li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
			<li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
			<li> '^':  lifts the pen
			<li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		</ul>
		For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.
		
		<p>
		Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
		<ul>
			<li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards
			<li> 'r':  change the pen color to red			
			<li> 'g':  change the pen color to green
			<li> 'b':  change the pen color to blue
		</ul>		

		<p>Submit your modified program (including a comment at the top of the program with your name).



	<li > <b>Due Date: 20 November</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 7</b><br>
		Write a program that allows the user to choose which currency they would like
		to convert.  Using the chart from #5, choose the currencies that begin with 
		the first five unique letters of your name.  You should print out the currencies
		your program will convert, ask the user for their currency choice, and then 
		amount of money to be converted.  Your program should then print the amount
		of money in the chosen currency.  For example:
<pre>
Sameh's Currency Converter
Converts from dollars into Somali Shilling, Afghan Afghanis, Moroccan Dirhams, 
Euros, and Hungarian Forints.
Choose a currency ('S', 'A', 'M', 'E', 'H'):  h
What amount: 1000

The chosen currency is:  Hungarian Forints
The converted amount is:  4.56

	Write a guessing word program.  First, pick a word, name, or phrase 
	for the user to guess (make sure that it is different from others' words so the 
	cheat-checking programs don't accidently
	match your program to others and that the word is not obscene (since it will be 
	flagged by the Blackboard system)). 
	
	<p>While the user has not guessed the word, print out two messages:  one
	that says whether the message that was entered is <tt>too short</tt>, <tt>just right</tt>, 
	or <tt>too long.</tt>  Your second message should tell the user if there guess 
	was before or after in the ordering of strings.
	Your game should continue until they guess your secret string and then should
	print a message congratulating them.

	<li> <b>Due Date: 9 December</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 9</b><br>

	
	Write a simulation of the rolling of 2 six-sided dice.  Your program should have
	a function that <tt>oneRoll()</tt> that returns the sum of rolling your dice.
	You may assume that each of the six sides is equally likely to be rolled (that
	is, the dice are "fair").  Run your simulation 10,000 times and report the 
	frequency that each sum occurred.  
	
	<p>A sample run of your program should look something like (but not identical
	due to the randomness of the simulation):
	<pre>
2 : 292
3 : 536
4 : 810

	numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  Modify the main() function to demonstrate your
	modified dice (it currently rolls 6-sided dice).
	
	
	<p>To submit your program, include the dice class and main() in the same file.
	No changes are needed to the button class or graphics module, so, no need to include
